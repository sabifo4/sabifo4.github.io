Hi all!

I am Sandra Álvarez-Carretero, a computer scientist currently doing my PhD at dos Reis Lab research group at Queen Mary University of London.

Even though now I cannot imagine a day working without my laptop, my path into academia 
started at the wet lab!

* __BSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ([Universidad Rovira I Virgili](http://www.urv.cat/es/estudios/grados/oferta/graudebioquimica/), Spain)__
: While I was studying my BSc, I soon realised after taking the bioinformatics course how much 
I enjoyed telling the computer to do __something__ with my 
biological data and actually getting __this something__ done 
(what I could not always say after my lab practicals...). There I decided I should focus on something 
that could integrate my two areas of interest: Biology and Informatics.  

* __MSc in Bioinformatics ([Högskolan I Skövde](http://www.his.se/en/#), Sweden)__
: After finishing the theoretical courses, I carried out my Master's thesis at [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/research/centre-for-translational-microbiome-research-ctmr), 
where I developed a pipeline to characterise bacterial isolates based on whole-genome sequencing data
 and other software pipelines to analyse transcriptomic and proteomic data. 

* __PhD student ([Queen Mary University of London](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/), UK)__
: Once I finished my MSc, I decided to explore other areas in the computer science such as 
bayesian statistics and modeling where I could learn more about the maths used in this field. 
Currently, I am carrying out my PhD at [**dos Reis Lab**](dosreislab.github.io) research group,
where I am working on the application of Bayesian MCMC statistical methods to 
study species divergences through time.
