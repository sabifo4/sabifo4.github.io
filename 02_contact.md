**_When I am not at work..._**

If I am not at the office, you might find me practising mySore Ashtanga Yoga with Susan Bish at [Yoga Place E2 studio](http://www.yogaplace.co.uk/london-class-schedule-prices-wo/) or attending one of Bianca Montesi's [yoga classes](https://www.biancayoga.net/) :) If you ever wanted to give yoga a go during your break time, I highly recommend you to attend their classes - they are both wonderful and highly qualified yoga teachers!! Come along and say hi :)
