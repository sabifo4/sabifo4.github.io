**_When I am not working..._**

... you might find me practising Mysore Ashtanga Yoga with [Susan Bysh](https://www.facebook.com/YogaPlaceMysoreStyleAshtanga) or attending one of [Bianca Montesi's yoga classes](https://www.biancayoga.net/).
I highly recommend joining their classes - they are both wonderful and highly qualified yoga teachers! Now you can even join their classes via Zoom, no need to be in London!
