I am Sandra √Ålvarez-Carretero, a computational biologist working as a research fellow at University College London with [Ziheng Yang](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/people/), [Phil Donoghue](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Philip-Donoghue-4fd2d6ef-3986-4566-97e4-7ae7db296525/), and [Mario dos Reis](https://dosreislab.github.io/about/). My main research interest is focused on developing and applying methods and computational tools to study evolutionary processes (e.g., phylogeny and timetree inference, detecting positive selection, etc.) with which analyses can be reproduced in a user-friendly manner. In my spare time, I collaborate with research groups in the same or different research areas to assist them building computational pipelines for various bioinformatics analyses.
