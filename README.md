# A journey through computational evolutionary biology

I am Sandra √Ålvarez-Carretero, a PhD student at [**dos Reis Lab**](dosreislab.github.io) research group at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/). 

My main project is focused on elucidating the evolutionary history of species through time by combining two sources of information: molecular data (genomes) and morphological continuous data (fossils). In order to do this, I am using and/or developing various bioinformatics tools focused on bayesian statistics. The main programming languages I use for this project are R, Perl, and bash. 

With this website, I aim to provide an overview of the different approaches we use and/or develop at the lab. You can visit it here: [A journey through computational evolutionary biology](https://sabifo4.github.io/)
