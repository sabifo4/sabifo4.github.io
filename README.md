I am Sandra √Ålvarez-Carretero, a postdoctoral researcher at [Ziheng Yang Lab](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/genetics-evolution-and-environment). My main research interest is focused on developing and applying new methods and computational tools in a reproducible and user-friendly manner to study evolutionary processes (e.g., phylogeny and timetree inference, positive selection, etc.). In my spare time, I collaborate with research groups in the same or different fields to assist them building computational pipelines for various bioinformatics analyses.
