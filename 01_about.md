Hi all!

I am Sandra Álvarez-Carretero, a computer scientist currently doing my PhD at dos Reis Lab research group at Queen Mary University of London.

Even though now I cannot imagine a day working without my laptop, my career started
at the wet lab and, little by little, I specialised in computer science:

* __BSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology__ *([Universidad Rovira I Virgili](http://www.urv.cat/es/estudios/grados/oferta/graudebioquimica/), Spain)*
: During this 4-year BSc, most of the practicals were wet lab-related. However, it was not until I took the bioinformatics course that I realised how much 
I enjoyed writing a code to tell a computer to do __"something"__ with my 
biological data and actually getting __"this something"__ done 
(what I could not always say after my wet lab practicals...). Thanks to the Erasmus+ programme, I could work on a bioinformatics project at the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/),
which was focused on troubleshooting and implementing a pipeline to carry out virtual screenings.
From then onwards, I was sure that my next steps in science 
had to integrate two fields: biology and informatics.  

* __MSc in Bioinformatics__ *([Högskolan I Skövde](http://www.his.se/en/#), Sweden)*
: After finishing the theoretical courses, I carried out my Master's thesis at [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/research/centre-for-translational-microbiome-research-ctmr), 
where I developed a pipeline to characterise bacterial isolates based on whole-genome sequencing data
 and other software pipelines to analyse transcriptomic and proteomic data. 

* __PhD student__ *([Queen Mary University of London](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/), UK)*
: Once I finished my MSc, I decided to explore other fields in computer science such as 
bayesian statistics and modelling where I could learn more about the maths used in this field. 
Currently, I am carrying out my PhD at [__dos Reis Lab__](dosreislab.github.io) research group,
where I am working on the application of Bayesian MCMC statistical methods to 
study species divergences through time.
