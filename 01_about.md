## __Education and Experience__

### Current

* __Senior Research Associate in Phylogenomics__ *([University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Sandra-Alvarez-Carretero-76142ecd-fddd-45c3-a712-787d3a906d30/), UK)*<br>My main interest is focused on developing and applying reproducible methods and pipelines to study evolutionary processes, and hence my research is focused on Bayesian timetree inference with molecular and morphological datasets (with both extant and fossil species). As part of the [Biological Purpose project](https://www.biologicalpurpose.org/subaward-project/chance-versus-purpose-biosphere-evolution) I have joined while in Bristol, I will be contributing to processing and analysing genome-scale datasets for deep timetree inference with the aim to unravel the patterns of early evolution of life.<br><br> My ultimate goal is to ensure that all the computational tools that I develop as part of the projects I am involved in are well documented, user-friendly, and reproducible.

### Past

* __Postdoctoral researcher__ *([University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/genetics-evolution-and-environment), UK)*<br>During these two-year position, I finished my [project on mammal evolution using the sequential-subtree approach](https://rdcu.be/cDHW7), worked on analyses for detecting positive selection, collaborated with various media and institutions for scientific outreach, and joined various projects focused on phylogenomic clock-dating analyses. During the academic year 2021-22, I was also a <b>teaching fellow</b> at UCL as part of a secondment, period during which I had the opportunity to further develop my teaching skills.
* __PhD in Computational Biology__ *([Queen Mary University of London](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/), UK)*<br>Once I completed my MSc studies, I wanted to explore other fields in computational biology such as Bayesian statistics and modelling as I was keen on integrating a more mathematical background with my computational skills at that moment. To achieve this, I started my PhD at the [dos Reis Lab](https://dosreislab.github.io/people/), at Queen Mary University of London, where I worked on the application of Bayesian MCMC statistical methods to study species divergences through time with both molecular and morphological quantitative data.
* __MSc in Bioinformatics__ *([Högskolan I Skövde](http://www.his.se/en/#), Sweden)*<br>After finishing the theoretical courses, I carried out my Master's dissertation at [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/research/centre-for-translational-microbiome-research-ctmr), where I developed a pipeline to characterise bacterial isolates based on whole-genome sequencing data and other software pipelines to analyse transcriptomic and proteomic data. My dissertation ["BACTpipe: Characterization of bacterial isolates based on whole-genome sequence data" can be accessed on the DIVA portal (free download)](http://his.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1197064&dswid=-2253). Since I finished my MSc research project, the computational research team at the [CTMR](https://ki.se/en/research/centre-for-translational-microbiome-research-ctmr) has been implementing new features in `BACTpipe`. The [current open source code is available as part of the `BACTpipe` GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctmrbio/BACTpipe).
* __BSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology__ *([University Rovira I Virgili](http://www.urv.cat/es/estudios/grados/oferta/graudebioquimica/), Spain)*<br>During these 4 years as an undergraduate, most of my practical sessions involved wet-lab experiments. Nevertheless, it was not until I took the bioinformatics course when I realised how much I enjoyed coding: if I properly told a computer to do <i>"something"</i> with my biological data, I actually got <i>"this something"</i> done (what I could not always say after my wet-lab practical sessions). Thanks to the Erasmus+ programme, I could work on a bioinformatics project at the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/), which was focused on troubleshooting and implementing a pipeline to carry out virtual screenings. From then onwards, I knew that my academic career had to integrate two fields: biology and informatics.
