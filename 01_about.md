Hi all!

I am Sandra Álvarez-Carretero, a computer scientist currently doing my PhD at [dos Reis Lab research group](https://dosreislab.github.io/) at Queen Mary University of London.

Even though now I cannot imagine a day working without my laptop, my career started
at the wet lab and, little by little, I specialised in computer science:

* __BSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology__ *([Universidad Rovira I Virgili](http://www.urv.cat/es/estudios/grados/oferta/graudebioquimica/), Spain)*
: During this 4-year BSc, most of the practicals were wet lab-related. However, it was not until I took the bioinformatics course that I realised how much 
I enjoyed writing a code to tell a computer to do __"something"__ with my 
biological data and actually getting __"this something"__ done 
(what I could not always say after my wet lab practicals...). Thanks to the Erasmus+ programme, I could work on a bioinformatics project at the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/),
which was focused on troubleshooting and implementing a pipeline to carry out virtual screenings.
From then onwards, I was sure that my next steps in science 
had to integrate two fields: biology and informatics.  

* __MSc in Bioinformatics__ *([Högskolan I Skövde](http://www.his.se/en/#), Sweden)*
: After finishing the theoretical courses, I carried out my Master's thesis at [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/research/centre-for-translational-microbiome-research-ctmr), 
where I developed a pipeline to characterise bacterial isolates based on whole-genome sequencing data
 and other software pipelines to analyse transcriptomic and proteomic data. 

* __PhD student__ *([Queen Mary University of London](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/), UK)*
: Once I finished my MSc, I decided to explore other fields in computer science such as 
bayesian statistics and modelling where I could learn more about the maths used in this field. 
Currently, I am carrying out my PhD at [__dos Reis Lab__](dosreislab.github.io) research group,
where I am working on the application of Bayesian MCMC statistical methods to 
study species divergences through time.

# __Outreach, events organisation, and research presentations__

#### *Nov 2017* 

   * **NERC DTP induction at QMUL**  
      Overview of the work carried out at dos Reis lab and about my PhD project. The practical part was focused on understanding the usage of the bioinformatics tools we use followed by a quick guide on a morphometrics analysis (acess [here](https://sabifo4.github.io/blog/Morphometrics_and_Procrustes_alignment)).

#### *Dec 2017 - Apr 2018* 

   * **Phylogroup XI**  
      During these four months, I supported the organisation of the Phylogroup XI event. My main tasks were to collect the proposals for the oral presentations, to help decide which talks would be selected for the event, and organise the schedule of the event.
      
#### *Mar 2018 - May 2018* 

   * **VI International Symposium SRUK/CERU**
